Veloura — static website
Folder structure:
- index.html
- css/styles.css
- js/main.js
- assets/*.svg (logo, hero, products, meloncat)
How to use:
1. Unzip the archive.
2. Open index.html in your browser.
Notes:
- This is a static demo for a Tumblr-like vintage/classy shop.
- The "Meloncat" animation uses assets/meloncat.svg when adding to cart.
- Checkout includes an interactive progress bar (game-like) — play or click steps.
Customize:
- Replace SVGs in /assets with real product images or higher-fidelity SVGs.
- Hook up real payment/address backend by replacing checkout confirm behavior.
